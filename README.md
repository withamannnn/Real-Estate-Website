It is a real estate website project for a real estate agency named DS Enterprises that will present its properties and services. The primary aim of the project is to create an intuitive interface that will help users move around in the available properties and easily contact the agency.
There are photo gallaries section in this website that provides high-quality images of properties.
There is teo contact form in the website that allows user to inquire about properties or services directly.
